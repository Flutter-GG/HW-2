        "post": "[unpaid/sample] I’m a fan of bath milks and of magnesium but it’s not going to take a leap of imagination to realise you can have both for less than the price of this which is £40 for 300ml. You need four or five capfuls according to the brand but I used it yesterday post yoga and in reality, to have a proper experience, you need more.Everything is relative I guess – I wouldn’t think twice if this was Chanel for example – so I suppose it depends on where you rate NEOM on the luxury scale. None of this is to say that it’s not a lovely product – it really is – it’s soothing, beautifully scented with lavender, jasmine and sandalwood which is a delicious combination, and blended with jojoba, argan, vitamin E and aloe vera. No dry skin post bath, I can assure you. I am also not sure that at the concentration suggested, the magnesium can have any power at all – I’d probably chuck in some salts as well if you really want a fuller magnesium experience. It’s a very pleasant luxury and it will be interesting to see how well it does.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample] Continuing on through the samples sent to me by Mary Quant, I’m focussing on the lipsticks today. There are 36 shade of which I have five, but they’re a very, very pleasant five! The texture is lush – soft, balmy, sheeny and comfortable. Not dissimilar to the glisting balm I featured the other day but with more pigment. On the subject of pigment, these are softly pigmented – there’s no drama to them and that’s the joy that makes them the easiest of wears. The shades don’t have names – they’re numbers. So from left to right, it’s B04, P01, R04, P04 and R09. The formulas are cream or sheer.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample] I posted about these blushers on Instagram yesterday and everyone was so surprised that Mary Quant make up was ‘back’, but to my mind it never went away. There was a Mary Quant shop at Duke of York Square just off the King’s Road only a few years ago and of course, the Mary Quant exhibition (where I bought a lipstick). However, it does look like it went into hibernation for a while last year. I haven’t quite got to the bottom of the ownership, other than it’s Japanese, and Mary Quant sold her business to Japanese owners in 2000  – James Matsumiya. The company name now is Mary Quant Cosmetics Ltd (of which there are two branches, MQCL London and MQCL Japan) as opposed to Mary Quant Ltd. It looks like James resigned as a company director, and amongst others, Yukari Nakamaya and Masako Nakamaya are now listed instead. I can’t track it any further than that because otherwise I would be here forever going down Companies House rabbit holes. It seems the company had a period of inactivity recently but is clearly now back and firing on all cylinders. I’ve got several products to review and I’m starting with the Cheeky Baby Souffle Blush. What I love about them is that they look so densely pigmented but are more of a translucent wash once on the skin. It’s a very natural, fresh finish.One of the clear benefits of Japanese ownership is that the make up has to a certain degree a Japanese aesthetic. This pinched cheeks look is really significant in Asia and it’s a very beautiful way to wear blush. The shades I have are (left to right) are 01 Apple Red, 04 Candy Pink and 02 Apricot Orange.I have Apricot Orange on my right cheek and Candy Pink on my left. You can see they look vibrant and fresh without looking bright and obvious.In the swatch (bottom to top) it’s Candy Pink, Apricot Orange and Apple Red. They’re £23 each HERE. There are three other shades that I don’t have here. I really do love this blush – it’s just understated and easy to wear, actually great on bare skin as well as over make up. I applied with a brush – literally just gently dab it at the mousse rather than scoop a big amount so you can build it to your preference. There’s a bit of a stain element too so it’s a stayer although will definitely stay better on bare skin than over foundation or base. What do you think? Did you have a favourite MQ product from back in the day?",

        "post": "[unpaid/purchase] A ‘glasting’ balm? New to me but it’s an extra shiny lip balm, apparently. I picked up the Rom&nd Glasting Melting Balm in my local Korean beauty store, K-Miso, which unexpectedly opened in Greenwich a few months ago. I can’t walk past it without buying something and the weekend’s purchase is this.As you can see, I dived into it without photographing it in pristine condition – I could not wait to try it! It’s exactly my kind of balm. Melting balms in the Korean sense are usually extremely soft – how they stay in a lipstick format is completely a mystery and it’s easy to apply to much because the texture is so different to regular balms and sticks. If you press too hard, your lips are covered in mush. The Glasting Melting Balm has a bit more hold so there’s not any danger of going in too heavily.Apparently this product has gone viral – people are loving it and I see why. It’s gorgeously juicy on the lips with just the right amount of colour set in plant based oils. I got mine HERE but they don’t seem to stock it on line, although if you prefer a matte, there are plenty of Rom&nd matte lipsticks available. However, I’ve found some stock at PureSeoul HERE including my shade Hippie Berry – they’re £13.90 each.",

        "post": "So many new launches from Jo Malone at the moment. Next up is the Lime, Basil & Mandarin Body and Hair Oil – their first foray into a multi-functional oil I think. Of all the original Jo Malone fragrances, this is my least favourite (my friend’s little daughter calls it her Pesto Perfume) because I’m just not a basil fan. But the oil formula is good – silky, lasting and hydrating – and a great way to fragrance your hair which is something I love to do. When they make this in Orange Blossom you will have to beat me in the queue for it. I do like how they’re paying attention to the older, original scents that were the making of this brand. I seem to remember that when Lime Basil & Mandarin first launched it was revelatory to bring an aromatic herb to mainstream fragrance when we were surrounded by launches such as Julio Iglesias, Spellbound by Estee Lauder and Coty Tribe. Bottom line here is that if you love the fragrance, you’ll love the oil. It’s launching in July for £42.",

        "postImage": "https://britishbeautyblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ziip-HALO-2-1100x967.jpg",
        "post": "I’ve trialled several devices with Current Body recently – I’m actually rather enjoying it. I do one post to explain the product, have a look at the claims and get to grips with the tech, and then another at the recommended ‘results’ time because I need to see what, if anything, the tool can do. I think I’m the right age (mid-fifties) for the ZIIP Halo (for which Current Body is the only UK stockist for) because younger skin is naturally more toned and bouncy. I’m not interested in turning back time and am happy in my skin, so the aspect of ZIIP that appeals to me most is freshness and radiance – both claims that the device makes. I take before and after pictures so that you can what you think. This device is founded by Melanie Simon, reportedly Jennifer Aniston’s facialist. Beauty tech is a key beauty trend that is still heading on an upward trajectory, bridging the gap between at home and salons treatments.To explain the ZIIP Halo properly, I’ve had to get to grips with nanocurrents. It turns out that nanocurrents and microcurrents are slightly different in that nanocurrents are smaller electrical currents than micro and work more effectively on skin at a cellular level by stimulating collagen and elastin production via the kinetic heat that’s generated. Microcurrents target muscle which is where the facial toning comes in. So, ZIIP Halo is working across the board to get both cells and muscles to work more efficiently.I’m also drawn by the ‘instant lift’ effect and the ease of use. You can, if you wish, use the app to guide you and while this is not a difficult device to use, I downloaded the app (reluctantly at first) and find it very useful. You can adjust your treatment to the time you have available – there is a range of suggested routines from two minutes to ten minutes as well as a ‘plan’ section so there’s an ‘event’ plan that shows you a week of intense treatments to ensure you are glowing for whatever event you want to look your best for.I’ll start on the New To ZIIP Halo 14 day plan which is as good as any place to begin. You should use the ZIIP Halo three to five times a week so a level of commitment is required. Obviously, you can come and go with it but if you want the best results, it’s going to take a certain level of compliance. I usually trial devices watching TV in the evenings or in bed in the morning (wine optional – possibly not for breakfast 😉 but you do you). ZIIP Halo is smooth in the hand, like a pebble, and very lightweight unlike some devices which make your arms ache like you’ve been weightlifting.In the above (very unglamorous!) pictures you can see a difference in my cheek on the right after using the 4 minute exercise. You will feel some tingling – it’s not painful but it is a strange feeling until you are used to it and you need a conducting gel (included). I’m sure you can use any conducting gel – ZIIP’s is quite pricy – so if you have some already, use that although I should say that ZIIP’s premium gels have skincare properties. The gel, like all conducting gels, is a bit tacky on the face but is suitable for all skin types – you can leave it on or take it off afterwards, it’s up to you. To start with, I’ve tried the 4 minute beginner session ‘The Lift’ on one side only – so you can take a look at the pictures and see what you think. I can see toning around my cheek area. I’ll be back in a few weeks to let you know how the longer term results are shaping up. In the meantime, the ZIIP is at Current Body for £349 HERE (shipping to UK and AUS, use this link HERE for US and Canada) – you can use JANEZIIP for 10% off the Halo (UK/USA/Canada) and any gels you might want to purchase.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample/affiliate/ad] I’m happy to see the new Vitamin Enriched Skin Tint from Bobbi Brown – it’s a product that could not be more up my street if it tried! On the Bobbi Brown website, there’s a brief FAQ section asking how the Vitamin Enriched Skin Tint is different to a BB Cream – honestly, as an early advocate of BB creams, I’ve by and largely forgotten about them completely. So many of the skin tints coming out now are BB Creams to the letter which continue their popularity in Asia but have gone by the wayside here. There’s no clear reason why other than brands have stopped marketing their tints as BBs.I’d say that this new tint is pretty much a standard tinted moisturiser and a good addition to the Vitamin Enriched franchise – beautiful texture, very hydrating and I’d recommend for older or drier skin types.The claims are for 12 hours of moisture and colour true wear, non-fading, non-creasing, non-settling, sweat and humidity resistant. The formula is using ‘pigment flex’ which is colour adaptive so your nearest shade should blend as your true shade. There’s SPF15 which is won’t make the current SPF50 advocates happy but I would be fine with this on a day like today (cloudy, occasional sun shine). Guidance from the World Health Organization is that a UV index of 3 and above will require sunscreen to prevent damage but bear in mind that the UK’s average UV index is 3.8 so for a good part of the year, SPF15 is adequate. It’s just common sense – higher SPF in summer, lower in winter, but ultimately, it’s up to you. The SPF waters have been very muddied by brands scaring us into SPF50 inside, outside, summer, winter and autumn. Eventually, there will be someone, somewhere, creating a night SPF.Bottom shade is Medium 2 (which I’m wearing) and top shade is Light 3. Med 2 is possibly just a bit on the warm side. I gave it about 6 and half hours before taking it off with a wipe so I could clearly see evidence of what was coming away. Actually, despite the fact that it didn’t look nearly as pristine as it did at the start, there was plenty coming off – my lipstick and blush had faded away so I didn’t look how I did at the start but the tint did a pretty good job. My skin definitely felt hydrated throughout. It’s pricy at £38 HERE but if you get along with the Vitamin Enriched range generally, it’s a good addition to your make up bag.",

I think perhaps I’ve had one bowl of Froot Loops in my whole life and I remember buying my own children a pack of Lucky Stars as an absolute one-off (I think from Selfridges!) and their Weetabix loving minds were blown.I don’t really know who this collaboration is aimed at – I mean, there will have been much market research/trend reporting for this to ever come about in the first place but I’m going to guess that it’s a TikTok thing.

        "post": "[unpaid/sample] I know that many of us are fans of the traditional soap. Personally, although I do have liquid soaps, I can’t ever see myself giving up on them completely. There’s something just so solid and reassuring about a proper block of soap. The English Soap Company is new to me although the brand is over twenty years old and they’re situated in Sussex. I asked them to send anything bright and beautiful and they’ve absolutely delivered. Rhubarb and Coconut soap will blow your mind, it’s so richly scented. It’s the bar that I’ve tested and I have it by my kitchen sink – I’m in my dining room office next door and I can smell it! To me, those two notes would not be natural bedfellows but it works. It’s always a good sign if you can smell the product before you take the wrappers off and I have to say, this has been one of the nicest parcels I’ve had in recent day because once the box was open it was just all about the fragrance.Now, that’s a proper soap :-). Interestingly, the English Soap Company uses palm oil which I slightly twitched about but if you ever had any questions on palm oil in products, read their explanation HERE. All of their oil comes from The Round Table of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Sustainably grown palm oil is a force for good by helping the environment, communities, employees and wildlife – it’s unsustainable palm oil that can be so damaging and destructive. I’m using almost word for word from the RSPO website which is another enlightening read HERE. Aside from the absolute burst of fragrance (which may be too sweet for some), this soap gave up a good lather which I was expecting, but also a lovely, fruity waft. I’m also getting a delicious aroma from the Mango & Peach soap – I think I prefer it so far but haven’t actually used it yet.I lit the Oriental Spice & Cherry Blossom candle before I had looked up any of the details – I can’t believe that it’s £11.50 and yet it gives off such a lot of fragrance. I’ve burned it for about three hours and the aroma was very present all throughout the kitchen. I actually think, compared to the soaps, it looks a bit old fashioned and the use of the world ‘oriental’ is very much out of favour in fragrance world. The fragrance is floral and powdery – there’s no spice in it as far as I can tell which makes the title misleading – but lilac plays a strong part, as does jasmine. The base is musk and woods, with other notes including violet, orchid and carnations. The brand uses soy wax, cotton wicks and reusable glass jars.If you’re a fan of candles, but don’t want the Dyptique prices, it’s definitely worth exploring this brand a bit more. They have a Cucumber & Watermelon soap, Bluebell & Jasmine and Jasmine & Wild Strawberry just for a start – there are literally so many. They’re £5.50 each which seems very reasonable to me HERE. Their paper wrap choices are stunning – there’s a collaboration with Kew Gardens which sends the illustrations more botanical but they’re really lovely to look at.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample/affiliate/ad] I’d really like to put together a montage of all the Guerlain feature Terracotta Bronzers to see how they’ve evolved over the years – they’re never not things of beauty. I showed this on Instagram yesterday and really had to steel myself to actually break into it and run a brush over it.Although I usually prefer cream bronzers, Flower Blossom is perfect for just a light ‘bonne mine’ touch to the skin. It’s completely weightless so you can build it up as you like but a quick ‘3’ formation from the forehead, dipping in to the cheek and sweeping back out again to just touch the jaw-line gives a very subtle warmth to the skin.I’m wearing no base at all here (just a bit of Jimmy Coco palest self tan) so you can see that Flower Blossom is very subtle. I could make it stronger and more present but I like this nuance that adds just a fraction more warmth.There are two Terracotta Luminizers as well – Cool Ivory and Warm Gold. The thing about these are that they are really quite subtle – I’m not really feeling for big ‘glow’ these days but a very light sweep of either of these, depending upon your tone, gives you just the right amount of luminosity. At that rate, they’d take forever to use up so you can try adding a touch to your lip balms – just mix in the palm of your hand and apply for a level up on a clear or coloured balm. You can also, using the flat of your finger, press into the eyelids. Back in the day, it would be suggested for just under the brown bone but that all feels a bit behind us now, do you think?This is something of a self indulgent photo but it’s rare to be able to capture the red Guerlain logo so brightly.Of the three, Flower Blossom is the most useful for obvious reasons – the gold detail is overspray so you won’t get a glitter shower from this so do gaze lovingly before it disappears, which it will in quick time. I’m sending you straight to Escentual because they have the bronzer for £39.10 HERE and everywhere else it’s £46. The Luminizers are the same price HERE.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample/affiliate/ad] Mr BBB and I once held a party at which we made lychee cocktails – I’ve honestly never seen so many people so smashed all at once! They were just too delicious and even now, if there’s a cocktail on the menu with lychee (also a bit weak for melon) in it, I’ll take it straight away :-). There’s nothing so dangerous about The Body Shop’s new Luscious Lychee range – I’m instantly sold although for preference (if only they’d asked 😉 I would have preferred it even more lychee-ish.I like the fact that the shower product is a cream rather than a gel although I think I would more describe it as a gel-cream but it’s actually done a pretty good job at being the same colour as an actual lychee – a sort of pink opal kind of hue.The body butter is nicely whippy which is better for summer legs I think and gives off a juicy, fruity scent with a lychee accent. As ever, there is a Fair Trade element – aloe vera is sourced from Mexico supporting female farmers.The Luscious Lychee Body Scrub would be my top buy – it’s exactly the right side of scrubby with fine grains and as you work it around your body the fragrance rises and hits your senses so you get the full hit. Delicious! I’ve noticed that the fragrance isn’t instantly gone with this – it lingers a little and now and again you get another (diluted) waft. It’s a bit pricy at £18 HERE but if you’re a lychee lover, worth the treat. The shower cream starts at £7 HERE, and the thing I forgot to mention (Dora brain!) is that there is sheet type cooling lychee eye mask for £6 HERE. I haven’t tried them yet but the blurb says ‘-1C Cooling Effect’ and that sounds very cool! Might shove one on my chest! In fact, why isn’t there one for the whole hot body?",

        "post": "This feather-light, non-sticky SPF50 is getting rave reviews for very good reason. I’ve been experimenting with it to wear under base and as we all know, when base and SPF interact then you get the dreaded squirls! Not all ingredients go nicely together, and it’s usually an oil and silicone clash to blame for the flaky squirls. I’m not a formulation expert, but I’ve put this with several tinted moisturisers and foundations and I have found very minimal interaction. Not none, but minimal. If you rub your face then it will happen slightly, so don’t rub your face and it will be fine!It comes out of the tube as above, but is completely transparent on the skin – no cast at all and just feels like a light, mattifying moisturiser with no greasy element at all. If you start piling on moisturiser on top of this, plus base you will get interaction but my skin felt hydrated enough by the Watery Essence. Maybe the most amazing thing about this is that it’s waterproof – something you’ll see if you apply it to your hands and then wash them – water forms droplets over your skin – and therefore sweat resistant. It’s on YesStyle for £9.28 HERE (you will get charged postage) instead of £23. It’s such a good example of the excellence of Japanese skin care and in particular, sun care.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample/affiliate/ad] I took this SPF gel with me to Stockholm last week to test it – yes, it was actually sunny in Stockholm so I’ve given it a good go and actually really like it. It’s not quite as lightweight as some UV gels I’ve tried but it’s so much of an improvement on other textures that I feel I am being picky by saying that.The reason that it’s not quite as air light is that it has sweat protection built in so you can very easily exercise in this without worrying that you’re sweating off your protection. Better yet, it has a strong skin care element so you’ll get some decent hydration with ingredients such as Uji tea, Licorice root and Camellia leaf extract. For an SPF 50 I think this texture is as good as you can get which is no surprise from a Japanese brand. There are other options – an SPF30 (on offer for £26.30 instead of £33 HERE), otherwise you’ll find the SPF50 HERE for £38.A big shout out for the Treatment Cleansing Oil – what a delight! It’s beautiful to look at for a start but performs as well as it looks. You give the bottle a good shake so that everything is ready for your skin and just three drops will sort you out for skin cleansing and make up removal. I’ll give a quick run down of the key ingredients – angelica leaf extract (first ingredient), rice ferment, squalane, olive oil and coconut oil. There’s a little kick of eucalyptus with grapefruit and lemon that make it feel like a refreshing cleanse – I found myself really inhaling those notes. It’s £42 which feels okay for the quality and the use enjoyment. It’s HERE. Althetis is exceptional skin care – I’d like to see it in wider distribution to get the recognition it deserves.",

        "post": "[unpaid/sample/affiliate/ad] I don’t know about you but we woke up to storms this morning – my hair is unspeakable, the air is sticky and the cloud is dense. But, all that aside, I’ve been trying out The Body Shop Zesty Lime Blossom and never was a fragranced range made more for a day like today. That little shot of lime is a real pep up.Straight to the fridge for this refreshing face and body mist – there’s something a bit Mojito-ish about it and in the way that we have imprinted scent associations, it’s reminding me of warm evenings on holiday. Your day is done, you’re on the wind down with something revitalizing and sparkling before the night ahead… it’s definitely a feel good fragrance mist. There’s more of a floral element to this than a fruit but again, it’s that almost tropical holiday smell with just a whisper of play-dough in the mix – and I really like that (By Far Daydream of Hopscotch has exactly that element and it’s my favourite from their collection). The mist is £12 HERE.Again – fridge! That cold flash that you’ll get from this water gel body yoghurt is delicious against a hot bod. I’m not a fan of heavy body moisturisers in summer – cannot bear that almost skin crawl feeling as your sweat glands rebel against this extra layer but this is lightness itself and probably more for the sheer pleasure than the ultra-hydration. The scent is a bit heady so I think might be nice before bed. It’s £12 HERE. The shower gel is just as you’d expect – a lighter burst of lime blossom but I can’t say anything against it because if you love the fragrance, it’s a great start to the day. It’s £7 HERE.",
