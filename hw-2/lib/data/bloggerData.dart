          "The Sun: its warm, magnificent — and absolutely critical to life here on Earth. If it failed to rise and set every day, wed be in quite a lot of trouble. We also often photograph the Sun — but its not always the star of the show.From sunkissed hair to the glimmeringly- lit curves of landscape photography, it would be very difficult not to capture the gentle caress of its refracted rays.Yes, the Suns illumination is essential for almost every type of photography. However, as true as this is and cheerful it is, its typically not the first astrophotography subject to come to mind!For one, the Suns movements contradict the predominantly nocturnal ones of most other popular astronomical subjects. But, besides that, it isnt the easiest or safest subject to photograph.",

      "body":
          "Pictures can preserve our dearest memories. You might have photos of loved ones, of you as a kid, or from someone special. Emotions and joyful memories can be experienced while looking at old photos. They help you recall some of life’s most beautiful moments. Unfortunately, physical pictures do not always stay in good shape; they can get damaged by water, fire, ripping, or the passage of time. It doesn’t matter how well you have cared for them; at one point or another, a part or the whole picture will no longer look like it used to. Luckily, there is a way to restore pictures and make them look as good as new. ",

          "Whether it’s a far-flung galaxy, the nearby orbiting Moon, or a once-in-a-lifetime astronomic event, astrophotography has a certain magic. Since cameras were invented, astrophotographers have been there to capture its beauty and movements — from eclipses to conjunctions. The earliest known attempt at astrophotography was a photograph taken of the Moon in 1839 by Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre — the inventor of the daguerreotype process. Of course, astrophotography and photography equipment and technology have come a long way since then! As a lover of the topic, I’m here to share my top tips on how to fine-tune your astrophotography — from camera settings to the ideal equipment to pack.",
