          "The small island of Bora Bora (just about 6 miles long and a little more than 2 miles wide) overflows with beauty. A dormant volcano rises up at its center and fans out into lush jungle before spilling into an aquamarine lagoon. In fact, author James Michener, who wrote Tales of the South Pacific, called Bora Bora the most beautiful island in the world. The 18th-century British explorer James Cook even coined it as the Pearl of the Pacific. The very definition of a tropical getaway, blissful Bora Bora abounds with luxurious resorts, sunny skies, warm waters and friendly locals.And as you might've already guessed, the main industry on this petite island in French Polynesia and its swarm of tiny motu (islands) is tourism. To that end, you can snorkel, explore Vaitape (Bora Bora's main port), hike Mount Otemanu and more. But there's a catch: Bora Bora is expensive – very expensive. In short, visit Bora Bora for natural beauty, visit for utter relaxation and visit if you have the money.",

          " The roughly 700 islands that make up the Bahamas lure millions of visitors to this paradise's white sandy shores, duty-free shops, fishing and scuba diving excursions and luxurious accommodations each year. Families that flock here tend to indulge in the diversions of Atlantis, Paradise Island and other mega resorts, but this diverse island chain also offers a range of activities away from the hotel zone. Nature enthusiasts can explore pristine protected areas like the Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve (on Eleuthera) and Lucayan National Park (on Grand Bahama Island) or take it easy at one of the country's many beaches or private islands. Meanwhile, history buffs can explore the ruins and artifacts from the colonial era and indigenous peoples like the Lucayan Indians. Plus, with cruise deals available year-round, it's no wonder why the Bahamas is such a popular vacation destination.",

      "description":
          "A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C. forced the center of what was then a single island to implode and succumb to the sea. Some say that this was the original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths. Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring.Your first order of business in Santorini is to hit the colorful beaches – the black and red sands make for a memorable visit. Next up, indulge in the archaeological delights of the impressively preserved Ancient Akrotiri or hike to Ancient Thera to see the ruins of three empires, including the Romans. From there, catch a breathtaking view of the caldera, a brilliant turquoise pool of water that serves as the nucleus for the varied isles of this archipelago. Some would say you only need a day to enjoy these islands' charms (they are a popular port of call for cruise ships), but to really drink in all Santorini has to offer, you'll need a few days to a week. Then you'll have plenty of time to learn there's more to these comely dots of the Cyclades than meets the eye..Santorini's volcanic activity plays a role in many of island's popular activities, from swimming and sunbathing at the molten-dyed beaches (such as Kamari Beach) to exploring ancient ruins once buried in ash (Ancient Akrotiri). Even the flavor of wine here is affected by the island's volcanic terrain, making a trip to one of Santorini's many wineries a must-do activity for foodies.",

          "Miles of shoreline, dozens of resorts, French cuisine to die for – Tahiti has all the makings of a honeymoon destination. But beach bums often pass over Tahiti's sands in favor of Bora Bora's ivory shores. Despite its idyllic reputation and accessibility, Tahiti is often more of a stopover point en route to romantic getaways on smaller islands. However, that doesn't mean Tahiti should be ignored.Leafy forests sit beside sandy shores, while French crêpes are served alongside Tahitian poisson cru (raw fish). If there ever was a place that embodies the beautiful duality of the French Polynesian archipelago, it's Tahiti. Here, the quirky, often chaotic atmosphere of the island's capital, Papeete, rubs elbows with uncorrupted natural beauty.In fact, Tahiti – the largest of French Polynesia's 118 islands – is often referred to as two separate islands despite them being joined by a tiny land bridge. Tahiti Nui is the larger, northwestern section where Papeete can be found. Tahiti Iti (the smaller, southeastern half) is less accessible, although many visitors make the trek here for the seclusion. Just note that spending a week on either part of Tahiti will cost you quite a chunk of change. Regardless, travelers agree that the warm waters, lush jungles and luxurious resorts are worth the splurge..one of the best ways to spend a Tahitian vacation is to lie back with a cocktail in hand, basking in the sunshine at your resort of choice. There’s plenty of adventure to be had, too. You can swim, snorkel, surf and more at places like La Plage de Maui or Plage du Taharuu...",

That kind of end-of-the-earth setting where the characters encounter mystical creatures, bewitching lands and elixirs that give you magical powers. In a way, the Azores is that fantastical place. The Azores, a group of nine islands located about 1,000 miles off the coast of mainland Portugal, were formed by a series of earthquakes and eruptions that took place thousands of years ago. Its Atlantic climate has given way to evergreen vegetation to take hold of its remaining debris, resulting in landscapes that are otherworldly and ripe for exploration.In the Azores, you'll find its islands dotted with miles-long calderas enshrouded in tropical foliage, filled with multi-colored lakes, centuries-old Portuguese villages, or all of the above. In the water, you'll find one-third of the world's cetacean species at any given time. And if you take a trip to Furnas Valley on São Miguel island, you can take a dip in thermal pools that contain minerals produced from a dormant volcano, which are believed to help with issues ranging from allergies to anemia. Whichever way you decide to take in the magic of the Azores, know you'll be hard-pressed to find a place like this anywhere else in the world. .The Azores is the kind of place you'd imagine to be the backdrop of a fantasy novel.
