        "details": "any linguists believe that the natural language a person speaks affects how they think. Does the same concept apply to computer languages? Programmers working in different kinds of programming languages often come up with radically different solutions to problems. As a more extreme example, computer scientists eliminated the goto statement to encourage more structured programs (not quite the same as totalitarian leaders in the novel 1984 expunging heretical words from natural language to eliminate thoughtcrimes, but you get the idea). What does this have to do with Flutter and Dart? Quite a bit actually. The early Flutter team evaluated more than a dozen languages, and picked Dart because it matched the way they were building user interfaces.",

        "details": "What is Flutter? The Flutter mobile app SDK is a new way to build beautiful native mobile apps that break away from the “cookie cutter” apps that have been so common in the past. People who try Flutter really like it; for example, see this, this, or this. Or here’s a list of articles and videos compiled by a third party. As with any new system, people want to know what makes Flutter different, or put another way, “what is new and exciting about Flutter?” That is a fair question, and this article will try to answer it from a technical viewpoint — not just what is exciting, but why. But first, a little history. A brief history of mobile app development Mobile app development is a relatively recent field of endeavor. Third-party developers have been able to build mobile apps for less than a decade, so it is no surprise that tools are still evolving. The Platform SDKs The Apple iOS SDK was released in 2008 and the Google Android SDK in 2009. These two SDKs were based on different languages: Objective-C and Java, respectively.",

        "details": "This time last year I published an article with my impressions of React Native, which was all the rage in 2016 and 2017, with companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Tesla, Walmart, Airbnb, Skype and more investigating it, or even actually implementing apps (or subsections) with it. But this year, React Native seems to be losing (or have already lost) much of its appeal, with some notable companies have announced they are abandoning it (check out this article by Airbnb’s  Gabriel Peal, or this other one by Udacity’s Nate Ebel). Talking to developers and judging from what’s being published in articles, or from what recruiters look for on LinkedIn, it would appear that it’s just not that hot anymore. To be clear though, it’s not dead and the fact that it didn’t work so well for some companies doesn’t mean that it won’t work for others. Many of these companies used it on subsections of their apps rather than on all of it, which is one of the reasons it was so complex to use. However, one can’t deny that if big companies that contribute to the popularity of a technology (by writing about it and creating popular open-source libraries for it) eventually decide to leave it, it has an impact on the community. At the very minimum, teams that were previously on the fence about using it had an easier decision to make, using posts such as the above to back up their arguments.",

Just since the Flutter 1.22 release in September, we’ve closed 5807 issues and merged 4091 PRs from 298 contributors. Special thanks go out to our volunteer contributors who generously give their spare time to improve the Flutter project. The top volunteer contributors for the Flutter 2 release were xu-baolin with 46 PRs, a14n with 32 PRs that focused on bringing Flutter to null safety, and hamdikahloun with 20 PRs that improved a number of the Flutter plugins. But it’s not just coders that contribute to the Flutter project; a great set of volunteer PR reviewers were also responsible for reviewing 1525 PRs, including hamdikahloun (again!), CareF and YazeedAlKhalaf (who’s only 16!). Flutter is truly a community effort and we couldn’t have gotten to version 2 without the issue raisers, PR contributors, and code reviewers. This release is for all of you.",

And yet, throughout the course of history, we’ve had many players in this space. We’ve had Flash, we’ve had Silverlight, all competing technologies that have attempted to shave off a slice of the browser market, to let the developer use a different technology to create a website. But none of them have really ever taken off. So how is it possible that I am coming to you, dear reader, and telling you that there could yet again be a competitor in this space?

In general, native development requires more effort from the development team to accomplish the project but it gives full control over tricky technical stuff under the hood.
